# Data-Analysis-with-Python-Practice
This is my practice for Data Analysis with Python

All this is my practice from my desktop. I took a course from iCodeGuru (www.icode.guru) where a mentor from silicon valley supervised us in this learning. It was an amazing learning expeirence. Many assignments and two projects.
